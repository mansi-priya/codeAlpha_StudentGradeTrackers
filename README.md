##Student Grade Tracker is a web-based Java application designed to collect and evaluate student performance. Built using HTML, CSS, JSP, and Servlets, it allows students to enter their name, roll number, number of subjects, and marks. The system then calculates the total, average, highest and lowest scores, and assigns a final grade based on performance. A clean and responsive interface guides users through the form submission and report generation process. The final report card is displayed in a structured and visually appealing format. This project is ideal for academic assessment automation and helps simplify student evaluation workflows.
